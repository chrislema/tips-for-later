This is not my primary blog. My main site is [chrislema.com](http://chrislema.com/) where I try to blog regularly – for entrepreneurs, WordPress folks, people who present in public, and product people.

I know – a lot to put in a single blog. But it all comes together in a way I like.

I’m a husband to one wife and the father of two children. I work as the VP of Products for a hosting company called [Liquid Web](http://liquidweb.com/).
