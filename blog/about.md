This is not my primary blog. My main site is [chrislema.com](http://chrislema.com/) where I try to blog regularly – for WordPress folks, about WordPress and WordPress products.

I also blog about leadership on a different blog, [leaders.blog](https://www.leaders.blog/) (I know, original).

I’m a husband to one wife and the father of two children. I work as the VP of Products for a hosting company called [Liquid Web](http://liquidweb.com/).
